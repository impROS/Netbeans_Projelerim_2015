transitions\r\nexhibit a clear and very similar zeeman splitting of approximately \u2212230 \u00B5evt g \u2243 \u22124 providing\r\nthe first measurements of the valley zeeman effect and associated gfactors in monolayer transition\r\nmetal disulphides these results complement and are compared with recent lowfield photolumines\r\ncence measurements of valley degeneracy breaking in the monolayer diselenides mose2 and wse2\r\nfurther the very large magnetic fields used in our studies allows us to observe the small quadratic\r\ndiamagnetic shifts of the a and b excitons in monolayer ws2 032 and 011 \u00B5evt\r\n2 respectively\r\nfrom which we calculate exciton radii of \u223C153 nm and \u223C116 nm when analyzed within a model of\r\nnonlocal dielectric screening in monolayer semiconductors these diamagnetic shifts also constrain\r\nand provide estimates of the exciton binding energies \u223C410 mev and \u223C470 mev for the a and b\r\nexcitons respectively further highlighting the utility of high magnetic fields for understanding new\r\n2d materials\r\natomicallythin crystals of the transitionmetal disul\r\nphides mos2 and ws2 and diselenides mose2 and\r\nwse2 constitute a novel class of monolayer semiconduc\r\ntors that possess direct optical bandgaps located at the\r\ndegenerate k and k  valleys of their hexagonal brillouin\r\nzones 1 2 the considerable recent interest in these 2d\r\ntransitionmetal dichalcogenides tmds derives from\r\ntheir strong spinorbit coupling and lack of structural\r\ninversion symmetry which together with timereversal\r\nsymmetry couples spin and valley degrees of freedom\r\nand leads to valleyspecific optical selection rules 38\r\nlight of \u03C3+ circular polarization couples to interband ex\r\nciton transitions in the k valley while the opposite \u03C3\u2212\r\ncircular polarization couples to transitions in the k  val\r\nley the ability to populate andor probe electrons and\r\nholes in specific valleys using polarized light has renewed\r\nlongstanding interests 811 in understanding and ex\r\nploiting such valley pseudospin degrees of freedom for\r\nboth fundamental physics and farreaching applications\r\nin eg quantum information processing\r\nthe bands and optical transitions at the k and k \r\nvalleys are nominally degenerate in energy and related\r\nby timereversal symmetry however in analogy with\r\nconventional spin degrees of freedom this kk  valley\r\ndegeneracy can be lifted by external magnetic fields b\r\nwhich break timereversal symmetry recent photolumi\r\nnescence pl studies of the monolayer diselenides mose2\r\nand wse2 in modest fields have indeed demonstrated this\r\nvalley zeeman effect and revealed an energy splitting\r\nbetween \u03C3+ and \u03C3\u2212 polarized pl from the lowestenergy\r\na exciton transition 1217 \u0131n most cases valley\r\nsplittings in these monolayer diselenides were found to\r\nincrease linearly with field at a rate of approximately\r\n\u22124\u00B5b \u2261 \u2212232 \u00B5evt where \u00B5b \= 579 \u00B5evt is the\r\nbohr magneton while this value agrees surprisingly well\r\nwith simple expectations from a twoband tightbinding\r\nmodel namely that electron and hole masses are equal\r\nand that the exciton zeeman shifts derive solely from the\r\nhybridized dx2\u2212y2 \u00B1 idxy atomic orbitals with magnetic\r\nmoment \u00B12\u00B5b that comprise the kk  valence bands\r\n1215 it is also widely appreciated that a more com\r\nplete treatment based on established k p theory should\r\nwith proper inclusion of strong excitonic effects also\r\nprovide an accurate description however initial k  p\r\nmodels have so far had limited success accounting for\r\nthe measured valley zeeman effect in monolayer tmds\r\n12 16 18\r\nat all events magnetooptical studies of these new\r\nmonolayer semiconductors are still at a relatively early\r\nstage and several outstanding questions remain \u0131n par\r\nticular measurements of valley zeeman effects in the\r\nmonolayer disulphides ws2 and mos2 have not been\r\nreported to date which would provide a natural com\r\nplement to the existing data on monolayer wse2 and\r\nmose2 \u0131n addition the valley zeeman splitting of the\r\nhigherenergy b exciton has not yet been reported\r\nin any of these 2d materials both of these stud\r\nies would provide a more complete experimental basis\r\nagainst which to benchmark new theoretical approaches\r\nand finally the diamagnetic energy shift of these exci\r\ntons which is anticipated to increase quadratically with\r\nfield and from which the spatial extent of the funda\r\nmental 1s exciton wavefunctions can be directly in\r\nferred 1921 has not yet been observed in any of the\r\nmonolayer tmds likely this is because the diamagnetic\r\nshift \u2206edia \= e\r\n2r21sb28mr is expected to be very\r\nsmall and difficult to spectrally resolve in these materi\r\nals owing to the small rootmeansquare rms radius of\r\n2the 1s exciton r1 \=\r\n\u221A\r\nr21s and large reduced mass\r\nmr \= m\r\n\u22121\r\ne +m\r\n\u22121\r\nh \r\n\u22121 for example if r1 \u2248 15 nm and\r\nme \= mh \u2248 m02 where m0 is the bare electron mass\r\nandmeh is the effective electronhole mass then \u2206edia\r\nis only \u223C20 \u00B5ev at b \= 10 t clearly motivating the need\r\nfor large magnetic fields crucially knowledge of \u2206edia\r\ncan also constrain estimates of the exciton binding en\r\nergy  a subject of considerable recent interest in the\r\nmonolayer tmds 2234 wherein the effects of nonlocal\r\ndielectric screening and berry curvature can generate a\r\nmarkedly nonhydrogenic rydberg series of exciton states\r\nand associated binding energies 3539\r\nto address these questions we report here a system\r\natic study of circularlypolarized magnetore\u015Fection from\r\nlargearea films of monolayer ws2 and mos2 at low tem\r\nperatures 4 k and in very high pulsed magnetic fields\r\nup to 65 t clear valley splittings of about \u2212230 \u00B5evt\r\nare observed for both the a and b excitons provid\r\ning the first measurements of the valley zeeman effect\r\nand associated gfactors in monolayer transitionmetal\r\ndisulphides moreover due to the very large magnetic\r\nfields used in these studies we are also able to resolve\r\nthe small quadratic diamagnetic shifts of both a and\r\nb excitons in monolayer ws2 032 \u00B1 002 \u00B5evt2 and\r\n011 \u00B1 002 \u00B5evt2 respectively permitting estimates\r\nof the rms exciton radius r1 these results are compared\r\nwith similar measurements of bulk ws2 crystals and are\r\nquantitatively modeled within the context of the non\r\nhydrogenic binding potential 22 35 36 that is believed\r\nto exist in 2d semiconductors due to nonlocal dielectric\r\nscreening within this framework we estimate a and b\r\nexciton binding energies of \u223C410 mev and \u223C470 mev\r\nrespectively and we show how these

lift the kk  valley degeneracy\r\nby shifting timereversed pairs of states in opposite direc\r\ntions in accord with the zeeman energy \u2212\u00B5 b this will\r\nzeemanshift the measured exciton

the\r\nvarious contributions to the total zeeman shift in the\r\nmonolayer tmds have been discussed in several recent\r\nreports 3 1215 42 which we summarize as follows \u0131n\r\ngeneral the total magnetic moment \u00B5 of any given con\r\nduction or valence band in the k or k  valley contains\r\ncontributions from three sources spin \u00B5s atomic or\r\nbital \u00B5l and the valley orbital magnetic moment that\r\nis associated with the berry curvature \u00B5k note that\r\nthe latter two have been referred to as intracellular\r\nand intercellular contributions to the orbital magnetic\r\nmoment respectively 12 13 the spin contribution to\r\nthe exciton zeeman shift \u2206ez is expected to be zero\r\nsince the opticallyallowed transitions couple conduction\r\nand valence bands having the same spin \u00B5cs \= \u00B5\r\nv\r\ns \u0131n\r\ncontrast the conduction and valence bands are com\r\nprised of entirely different atomic orbitals the dz2 or\r\nbitals of the conduction bands have azimuthal orbital\r\nangular momentum lz \= 0 \u00B5\r\nc\r\nl \= 0 while the hybridized\r\ndx2\u2212y2 \u00B1 idxy orbitals that comprise the valence bands\r\nhave lz \= \u00B12h\u0304 \u00B5vl \= \u00B12\u00B5b in the k and k  valleys\r\nrespectively this contribution is expected to generate a\r\nzeeman shift of the k and k  exciton of \u22132\u00B5bb respec\r\ntively and therefore a total exciton splitting of \u22124\u00B5bb\r\nfinally the valley orbital berry curvature contribu\r\ntion to the conduction and valence band moments are\r\n\u00B5ck \= \u00B1m0me\u00B5b and \u00B5vk \= \u00B1m0mh\u00B5b in the k\r\nand k  valleys respectively \u0131n a simple twoband tight\r\nbinding model where me \= mh then \u00B5\r\nc\r\nk \= \u00B5\r\nv\r\nk and

correct\r\nrms radius r1 for example using mra \= 016m0 for the\r\na exciton in ws2 and using the measured diamagnetic\r\nshift \u03C3a we find that r1a \= 153 nm via eq 3 a\r\nwavefunction \u03C81sr with this rms radius shown explic\r\nitly in fig 3a is calculated if and only if the screening\r\nlength r0 \= 53 nm and the binding energy of this state is\r\n410 mev for comparison this inferred screening length\r\nis somewhat larger than expected for a suspended ws2\r\nmonolayer where r0 \= 2\u03C0\u03C72d \= 38 nm 22 but is\r\nless that the value of 75 nm used recently by chernikov\r\n23 to fit a nonhydrogenic rydberg series of excitons in\r\nws2 from re\u015Fectivity data similarly the 410 mev ex\r\nciton binding energy that we estimate exceeds the value\r\ninferred by chernikov 320 mev but is less than the 700\r\n830 mev binding energies extracted from twophoton ex\r\ncitation studies 24 25 and re\u015Fectivityabsorption stud\r\nies 27 of monolayer ws2 we emphasize however that\r\nthe exciton wavefunctions and binding energies that we\r\ncalculate necessarily depend on the reduced massmr and\r\nthe exact form of the potential v r which is sensitive\r\nto the details of the dielectric environment and choice of\r\nsubstrate material 32 48\r\nmore generally fig 3b shows a colorcoded surface\r\nplot of the exciton binding energy calculated within the\r\nframework of the

for a and b excitons\r\nie r0 is unchanged then parameters for the b exciton\r\nlie at a point on the \u03C3b contour that is directly to the\r\nright of those on the \u03C3a contour thus if mra \=

consistent with trends identified\r\nin early optical studies of bulk mos2 crystals 46 47 in\r\nwhich b exciton masses and binding energies were found\r\nto exceed those of a excitons these results

\u00B5evt\r\ng \= \u2212333 in excellent agreement with early mag\r\nnetic circular dichroism measurements of gfactors in\r\n7bulk ws2 49 wherein it was suggested that deviations\r\nfrom g \= \u22124 arise from the crystalfield mixing of ptype\r\nchalcogen atomic orbitals into the predominantly dtype\r\ncharacter of the conduction and valence bands within\r\nthis context the value of g \u2243 \u22124 that we measured in\r\nmonolayer ws2 see fig 2f suggests that such mixing\r\neffects may be suppressed in atomicallythin ws2 \u0131n\r\naddition fig 4d shows that the measured diamagnetic\r\nshift of the a exciton in bulk ws2 is 064 \u00B5evt\r\n2 which\r\nis twice as large as in monolayer ws2 assuming an in\r\nplane reduced mass ofmr \= 021m0 in bulk ws2 51 we\r\ncalculate via eq 3 an inplane rms radius of 248 nm for\r\nthe bulk a exciton which is substantially larger than in\r\nferred for monolayer ws2 further using an effective di\r\nelectric screening constant

2d note however that these estimates\r\ndepend on the assumed value of the reduced mass mr\r\nwhich has not yet been measured independently by eg\r\ncyclotron resonance studies\r\nvalley zeeman effect

shell bash\r\na\u0131m\r\nthe aim of this experiment is to get students familiar with both the session and the \r\nprogramming environment of the unix linux operating system\r\nunix and its variants have become the defacto ie not in writing but by common consent \r\nindustrial standard for server systems \u0131n recent times \u015Favors of unix linux have been ported \r\nto machines with limited hardware such as pcs personal computers a working knowledge of \r\nunix will probably be the best advantage of a computer engineer in the future\r\nbackground\r\nwith unix users can access the system via a terminal after the autentication phase login a \r\nspecial program called shell runs for each user outputting a prompt normally a $ sign on \r\nthe screen  a shell can be described as a layer between the user and unix itself \u0131t is a \r\ncommand line interpreter through which a user can execute ready made programs called shell \r\ncommands such as ls ps cp mv cat etc  a shell has also programming capabilities \r\nlike loops and conditional executions \u0131t then gives users the possibility to write scripts  to \r\ndefine a specific job as a whole a script is a collection of commands or executable programs \r\nalong with programming language structures such as loops and conditions a script can be \r\nconsidered as a program where the statements instructions are the commands a shell script is \r\nstored in a file with a given name \u0131t is executed every time this file name is stated\r\nthe most common shells for unix are sh bourne shell and bash bourne again \r\nshell \u0131n this experiment you have to use bash for its usage please refere to the \r\ndocuments defined in the references\r\nshell redirection is a base for un\u0131x systems unless clearly specified shell commands takes their \r\ninput from the keyboard and directs their output to the screen the > operator specifies to the \r\nshell that the output of a command is to be redirected to a file following the > sign similarly \r\nthe < operator tells the shell that the input is to be taken from a file additionally there is \r\nanother feature of un\u0131x that allows the user to specify successive file redirections called pipe \r\nthis feature allows the redirection of the output of a program to the input of another one\r\nobject\u0131ve\r\n\u0131n this experiment you are asked to write a simple table manipulator script a shell program \r\na table consists of a defined number of columns and rows the script will be used to handle \r\ntables to create or delete tables and records insert or delete data rows within the tables \r\nrelated to a given database\r\nyour script should have a command line in order for the users to type commands such as create \r\ntable delete table insert or delete row to a given table quit the program help etc\r\ntable operations\r\nb\u0131l235 experiment v\r\ncreatetable before creating the table your program should ask the user the table name \r\nthe number and the names of the columns\r\ndeletetable your program should ask the user the table name and confirmation before \r\ndeleting\r\nrecord operations\r\ninsertrecord this command will append a row at the end of a table your program should \r\nask the user the table name fields names and contents\r\ndeleterecord this command will delete rows according to a given criteria for instance \r\ndelete records where a given column includes a given string delete record 37 delete record \r\n37 etc your program should ask confirmation before deleting\r\nsort table this command will put rows in alphabethicalnumerical order according to a \r\ngiven column your program should ask the user the table and column names as well as the \r\nsorting method alphabethicalnumerical
